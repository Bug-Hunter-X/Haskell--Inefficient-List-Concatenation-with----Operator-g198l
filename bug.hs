This Haskell code attempts to use the `++` operator to concatenate lists, but it does so inefficiently within a loop.  The `++` operator has O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the first list.  Repeated use within a loop leads to O(n^2) overall complexity.

```haskell
buildList :: Int -> [Int]
buildList n = buildListHelper n []

buildListHelper :: Int -> [Int] -> [Int]
buildListHelper 0 acc = acc
buildListHelper n acc = buildListHelper (n - 1) (acc ++ [n])
```
